# Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest

## Description
Customer retention is one of the key metrics for businesses with a subscription/contract-based model. Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using the company's product or service during a certain time frame. Predicting customer churn is a challenging but important business problem as the new customer acquisition is expensive. So by predicting the customers who are at a high risk of churning, the company can take actions to reduce the chance of these customer canceling their subscriptions.

## Goals
Make RandomForestClassifier work and figure out how to optimize its predictive performance.
See if it performs better than commercial programs
Undertand why Random Forest works
Investigate the mechanisms of overfitting, high correlation, other pitfalls of ML algorithms
